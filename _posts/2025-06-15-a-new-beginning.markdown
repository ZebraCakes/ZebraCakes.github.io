If you're reading this, chances are I either posted it on facebook, or linked it to you on discord.

Short version, I am finally pulling the trigger and deleting my facebook account soon, and figured I would put up a blog so that anybody who cares to follow my life has a place to look.

I'm not sure what all I'll be putting here, but it will be a mix of what's going on in my admittedly quite boring life, some programming projects if they ever get off the ground, and updates on a game/games that a friend and I recently started on.

Hope you stick around. For now I'm going to try to have something out weekly.
